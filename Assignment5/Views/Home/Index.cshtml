    @* // A few paragraphs about why I like basketball so much and what it means to me. *@

    <p>Basketball is easily my favorite hobby because it hits that perfect mix of fun, challenge, and stress relief. The moment I step onto a court, everything else gets quieter—classes, work, whatever is going on that week. It’s just me, the ball, and the next play. I love how fast the game moves and how every possession feels like a fresh chance to do something better than the last one.</p>

    <p>What really draws me in is the teamwork aspect. Basketball isn’t just about individual skill; it’s about how well you mesh with your teammates. Setting up plays, communicating on defense, and celebrating each other’s successes make it a social sport that builds camaraderie. Plus, the physical activity is a great way to blow off steam and stay fit.</p>

    <p>Overall, basketball is more than just a game to me—it’s a way to connect with others, challenge myself, and have a blast all at once.</p>
